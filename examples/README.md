# Examples

This directory contains examples that show how to use this library as a developer in your own programs.
These examples are not built together with the main build system, but must be built separately.
Due to this, they require `fftune` to be installed system-wide.

The following examples are provided:
- [minimal](minimal/): A minimal example showing how to integrate this library into your build system
- [basic](basic/): A basic example demonstrating how to use the pitch detection capabilities of this library
- [pipewire-realtime](pipewire-realtime/): An advanced example showing how to process audio in realtime that is recorded live with the Pipewire audio system
